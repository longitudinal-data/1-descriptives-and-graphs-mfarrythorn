Move your data into a long format and a wide format. Did you have any specific challenges that you encountered? If so, discuss them.

Create a wave variable and date variable (if applicable).

What is your sample size for each wave of assessment?

Take the date variable and convert it to a different date format such as time in study or age (if appropriate). What scale is most suitable for your analyses? (weeks/months/years?)

Graph your data using the different time metrics, fitting individual curves for each person.

Create an overall average trend of your data (split up into groups if appropriate). Attempt to color your individual data points and/or shade different lines (highlight some particiapnts, highlight the average trend line but not the individual level lines)

Look at the correlations of your DV across time
